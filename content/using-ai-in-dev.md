# Using AI in dev

The recent rise of AI usage in development is looking strong and useful. The
issues could be resoled faster then ever, bugs found faster, code samples
generated faster then ever. Everything looks better when using AI helpers.

I started using Chat GPT, the free version and it was laggy, some times I wasn't
able to use it at all because of unknown reasons to me. Later I started using
Jetbrain Goland idea with it's AI tool which I purchased. It's awesome and it
helps a lot with all the development tasks, it allowed me to work faster then
ever.

After some time of using, I think 2-3 months in to it I started noticing that
my skills stoped growing, my knowledge stopped growing and I felt borring all
the time in my work. Well at first I thought that it's because the work it self
is not suiting me anymore, it's borring and etc., but in the job I was working
I got a new project
